# Entry-Level--Data-Analysis-Program
Training on Data Analysis with Entry level. 
This project discuss about a Data Analyst working for the education tech company Udemy. You have been asked by your manager, Head of Curriculum at Udemy, to present the data on course revenue, and you have been provided with data on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses.
Your manager has suggested encouraging Web Development courses to charge more, because she believes that these are the most popular courses. She needs to send a report to the CEO in the next three weeks on how they will increase their next quarter earnings.
